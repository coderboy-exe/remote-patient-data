            Our flagship panel, Nala Outpatient, targets common medications
            causing 8% of hospital admissions
          </h2>
          <p>
            Nala Outpatient is a pharmacogenomics test designed to analyze the
            five genes and 30+ most commonly prescribed drugs in an outpatient
            setting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though 81% of doctors believe that pharmacogenomic testing would be
            useful, only 46.4% feel competent enough to implement the science
            into their practice. We seek to bridge this gap by offering a full
            suite of simple, easy-to-use pharmacogenetic tools.

                The test will show your patient’s important pharmacogene
                phenotype and its implication on each of the drug response. This
                implication will be augmented with trusted recommendations taken
                from well-known consortia such as CPIC (Clinical
                Pharmacogenomics Implementation Consortium) and DPWG as well as
                from regulatory bodies such as The US’s FDA and Europe’s EMA. To

                The recommendations stated in the report are always backed by
                scientific evidence. Should the report’s caveat mention that the
                recommendation is only for a certain condition, it means that we
                do not have sufficient information to provide a genetic-based
                recommendation for other conditions. We advise that you exercise
                your clinical judgment in such cases.
